1. modify GetData2 so it includes the header/firstline to name the variables
--> the file "covered samples" needs to be extended with the values for the layerssss

2. make the file "JOINED SAMPLE INFO" so that covariates file is not only NAs and hyperlinks


3. make everything "dynamic" 



DONE: make tidyverse run on minionserver
